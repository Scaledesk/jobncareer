Increase average order value by letting your customers purchase additional options on your products
== Description ==

With YITH WooCommerce Product Add-ons you'll be able to increase your customers' propensity to spend more and you'll be able to cut off time dedicated to managing additional options for each product separately. How? Let's imagine you have a jewellery store and one of your customers is going to purchase a ring: if variations can let them decide whether they prefer it in gold, silver or copper, how can you let them have a brief sentence carved on it and associate an extra cost to this in product page? YITH Product Add-ons allows you either to add a text field where your users can enter their sentence or select the one you have already configured for them through checkboxes or radio buttons in product page. And you'll forget about long and messy email correspondences where the risk to mix up orders from different customers is just around the corner.

**Features:**

*    Create groups of options And choose to use them for all products of the shop, only for specific categories or limited on a single product
*    Choose from different options Checkbox and Radio button
*    Set dependency between the options To show a dropdown option only to users who selected the one that depends on it
*    Increase the cost of product by assigning a fixed price to any of the options selected by user
*    Specify single options By setting label and description
*    Show a tooltip for the product add-ons

== Installation ==
Important: First of all, you have to download and activate WooCommerce plugin, which is mandatory for YITH WooCommerce Product Add-Ons to be working.

1. Unzip the downloaded zip file.
2. Upload the plugin folder into the `wp-content/plugins/` directory of your WordPress site.
3. Activate `YITH WooCommerce Product Add-Ons` from Plugins page.

= Configuration =
YITH WooCommerce Product Add-Ons will add a new tab called "Products Add-Ons" in "YIT Plugins" menu item. There, you will find all Yithemes plugins with quick access to plugin setting page.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I add options groups on variable products? =
Yes, the plugin allows to do it. Options can be configured globally on product, but not on single variation.

= Can I disable global options on single product? =
Yes, you can do it, but not singularly. From the product editing page, you can disable the use of "all" global options groups.

= I would like to show an option only when a specific combination of options chosen from users occurs. How can I do it? =
You must enable the dependency on the option you are interested in by inserting the name of options you want your users to select.
